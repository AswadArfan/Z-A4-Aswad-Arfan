        <div class="box Introduction">
            <h3>Introduction to C Programming</h3>
            <p>C is a powerful and versatile programming language that was developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs.
                It has since become one of the most widely used programming languages due to its efficiency, portability, and close-to-hardware capabilities. 
                C is known for its structured approach and is often used for system-level programming, embedded systems, and low-level software development.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box Data-Variables">
            <h3>Data Types and Variables in C</h3>
            <p>In C programming, data types define the type of data a variable can hold and the operations that can be performed on it. 
                C supports fundamental data types like integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans. Additionally, 
                it allows the creation of user-defined data types using structures and enumerations, providing flexibility in data representation and manipulation.</p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="box Control-flow">
            <h3>Control Flow and Decision Making in C</h3>
            <p>Control flow in C involves making decisions and directing the flow of the program's execution based on specific conditions. 
                The language provides conditional statements like 'if,' 'else if,' and 'switch' to control the program's behavior. Loops such as 
                'for,' 'while,' and 'do-while' enable repetitive execution of code blocks, making C programs efficient and dynamic.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box memory">
            <h3>Memory Management in C</h3>
            <p>C allows direct memory manipulation through pointers, making it essential to understand memory management to avoid memory leaks and segmentation faults. 
                Dynamic memory allocation functions like 'malloc' and 'free' are used to allocate and release memory during runtime, allowing for efficient memory 
                utilization and resource optimization.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box File-handling">
            <h3>File Handling in C</h3>
            <p>File handling is crucial for data storage and retrieval in any programming language, and C provides various file-related functions 
                to read from and write to files. Using 'fopen,' 'fread,' 'fwrite,' and 'fclose,' programmers can interact with files, enabling tasks 
                such as data persistence, logging, and inter-process communication.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box Modularity">
            <h3>Modularity and Functions in C</h3>
            <p>Functions are the building blocks of modular programming in C. They allow developers to divide large programs into smaller, 
                manageable pieces, improving code organization and reusability. C supports both user-defined functions and library functions, 
                making it easy to develop complex applications by combining existing functionalities.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box Pointer-array">
            <h3>Pointers and Arrays in C</h3>
            <p>Pointers are a distinctive feature of C, allowing direct memory access and manipulation. They are used extensively for dynamic 
                memory allocation, accessing hardware, and optimizing certain operations. Arrays, on the other hand, provide a way to store 
                multiple values of the same type sequentially, forming an integral part of data structures and algorithms in C.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box advanced">
            <h3>"Advanced Concepts</h3>
            <p>Recursion, where a function calls itself, is a powerful technique used in solving complex problems and handling hierarchical data structures. 
                Preprocessor directives, denoted by '#' symbols, provide instructions to the compiler before compilation, enabling conditional compilation 
                and code inclusion for enhanced code flexibility. Understanding these advanced concepts is crucial for mastering C programming.</p>
