        <div class="box Introduction">
            <h3>Introduction to JavaScript</h3>
            <p>JavaScript is a powerful and versatile programming language that is commonly used to add interactivity and dynamic content to websites.
                This section provides an overview of JavaScript's history, its role in web development, and its integration with HTML and CSS. 
                You'll gain insights into the basic syntax and key concepts to kickstart your journey into JavaScript programming.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box Data-Types">
            <h3>JavaScript Data Types and Variables</h3>
            <p>Understanding data types and variables is fundamental in any programming language. In this section, you'll explore the various 
                data types supported by JavaScript, such as numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, and objects. You'll also learn about variable 
                declarations, scoping, and best practices for naming variables.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box Control-Flow">
            <h3>Control Flow and Conditional Statements</h3>
            <p>Control flow structures allow you to control the flow of execution in your JavaScript code. Here, you'll learn about conditional
                statements like if-else, switch, and ternary operators, which enable your programs to make decisions and perform different 
                actions based on specific conditions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box Functions">
            <h3>Functions and Scope in JavaScript</h3>
            <p>Functions are a crucial part of JavaScript, promoting modularity and code reusability. This section delves into function declarations, 
                parameters, return values, and how to handle scope in JavaScript. You'll understand the differences between global and local scope 
                and how closures work.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box Arrays">
            <h3> Arrays and Array Methods</h3>
            <p>Arrays are essential for storing and manipulating collections of data. In this section, you'll explore JavaScript arrays, learn about 
                common array methods like push, pop, slice, map, and reduce, and understand how to loop through arrays using iteration methods.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box OOP">
            <h3>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript</h3>
            <p>JavaScript supports object-oriented programming, allowing you to create and work with objects and classes. Here, you'll learn about 
                object literals, constructors, prototypes, and how to leverage OOP principles to build more organized and scalable code.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box Async">
            <h3>Asynchronous Programming with Promises and Async/Await</h3>
            <p>JavaScript is single-threaded, which means it processes one task at a time. However, it can handle asynchronous operations using 
                Promises and Async/Await. This section will guide you through handling asynchronous tasks, making network requests, and managing 
                callbacks more efficiently.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box DOM">
            <h3>DOM Manipulation and Event Handling</h3>
            <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) allows JavaScript to interact with HTML and CSS, enabling dynamic web page updates. Here, you'll 
                learn how to access and modify elements on a webpage, as well as how to respond to user interactions through event handling.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box Frameworks">
            <h3> Introduction to Front-end Frameworks (e.g., React or Vue.js)</h3>
            <p>Front-end frameworks enhance JavaScript's capabilities for building complex and interactive user interfaces. In this section, 
                you'll be introduced to popular front-end frameworks like React or Vue.js, understand their core concepts, and learn how to 
                create dynamic and reactive web applications using these technologies.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box Error">
            <h3> Error Handling and Debugging in JavaScript</h3>
            <p>As a JavaScript developer, encountering errors and bugs is inevitable. This section focuses on effective error handling 
                techniques and debugging strategies in JavaScript. You'll explore methods like try-catch blocks, console logging, and 
                browser developer tools to identify and fix issues in your code, ensuring smoother and more reliable JavaScript applications.</p>
